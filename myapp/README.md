Modern UI: Built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS for a seamless, responsive interface.

How MyApp Works
Overview
MyApp simplifies business operations by integrating a robust backend API with an intuitive frontend interface. The Django backend exposes RESTful endpoints for all entities, while the Next.js frontend enables users to interact with data efficiently.
Backend (Django REST API)

Structure: Organized into Django apps for each entity (Artisan, Customer, Product, Job, Order, Inventory, Payslip), with models, serializers, views, and URL routes.
Authentication: Endpoints are open by default for development but can be secured with Django REST Framework permissions (e.g., JWT or token-based authentication).
Filtering & Search: Supports query parameters for filtering, searching, and sorting (e.g., ?search=John&ordering=-created_date).
PDF Generation: Payslips are generated as PDFs using the reportlab library.
CORS: Configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend during development.

Example API Flow

Create a Customer: POST /api/customers/ with customer details.
Create an Order: POST /api/orders/ referencing a customer and products.
Assign Jobs: POST /api/jobs/ to assign artisans to specific tasks.
Generate Payslip: POST /api/payslips/ to create artisan payment records.

Frontend (Next.js)

Pages: Dedicated pages for each entity (e.g., /artisans, /customers, /jobs, /orders, /inventory, /payslips).
Data Fetching: Uses fetch to interact with REST API endpoints, with the base URL set via NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL.
UI Components: Features interactive forms for data entry and tables for viewing records, with filtering and search capabilities.
Real-Time Updates: Supports updating order and job statuses (e.g., mark job as complete).
Reports: Displays analytics for business insights, such as job completion rates and financial summaries.

Example User Flow

(Optional) Log in or register if authentication is enabled.
Add customers via the /customers page.
Define products/services in the /products section.
Create orders for customers, selecting products and quantities.
Assign artisans to jobs linked to orders.
Monitor inventory levels and product usage.
Generate payslips for completed jobs.
View reports for operational and financial insights.

Node.js: 18+
npm: 9+
Git: For cloning the repository
(Optional) PostgreSQL for production database

Setup Instructions
Backend (Django)

Clone the repository:git clone <repository-url>
cd myapp/appback


(Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt


Apply migrations and start the development server:python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.

Frontend (Next.js)

Navigate to the frontend folder:cd myapp/my-app


Install dependencies:npm install


Create a .env.local file and set the API base URL:echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/" > .env.local


Start the development server:npm run dev

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
